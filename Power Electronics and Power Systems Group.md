**Welcome to the Power Electronics and Power Systems Group** in the **Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Indore**. The focus of this group is to address the pressing needs of India in the area of power electronics and power systems by working on High step up DC-DC converters for Renewable energy sources, Smart Grid and Distributed Generation, Wide area measurement system applications, electric vehicle and transportation electrification, and power quality analysis. Electric machines and Power Electronics UG lab come under the purview of this group. The lab is well equipped to impart practical skills for UG, PG, and Ph.D. students in fields of power electronics, machines and drives. It also helps to fabricate experimental setups with quality to support research projects of the Institute.
